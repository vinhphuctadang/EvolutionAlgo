Repo to store every evolution attempt to solve problems, for study only

That could be ridiculous, but I am new to the evolution algos
Being inspired by Darwin with natural selection and evolution theory

```
Step One: Generate the initial population of individuals randomly. (First generation)

Step Two: Evaluate the fitness of each individual in that population (time limit, sufficient fitness achieved, etc.)

Step Three: Repeat the following regenerational steps until termination:

1. Select the best-fit individuals for reproduction. (Parents)
2. Breed new individuals through crossover and mutation operations to give birth to offspring.
3. Evaluate the individual fitness of new individuals.
4. Replace least-fit population with new individuals.
